Years ago, Alan Wake got me into listening Poets of the Fall. It was also one of those games that I enjoyed the story so much that I read the novel for it too.

Ever since Control’s release, I’ve been wanting to play Alan Wake again. I considered doing so right after, but rumors was spreading from an Epic Games leak that a remaster of Alan Wake was to be released. So, I waited until then.

A couple nights ago, I finished the remaster.

Nostalgia is a strange beast. The light as a weapon mechanic still remains fun, but I felt like I enjoyed the game less than before. I liked the voice over that I felt was a continuation of the narrative style of Max Payne, which worked very well with in setting the atmosphere as well as providing exposition with the voiced notes.

However, Alan Wake does feel like it overstays its welcome in the later half. The last mission was essentially just running, driving, going against wave of enemies, and repeat. Repeated mechanics isn’t bad. The problem isn’t with the lack of weapons or new abilities, but that the narrative started to feel like it was taking a back seat and only occasionally come up during cutscenes. In fact, I’d argue that a lot of modern games which try to blend in RPG elements end up with overloading way too much skills and abilities. What I did like though, was the that there wasn’t a regular boss fight at the end. I’m not a fan of boss fights in general, because many of them just end up making you unlearn what ever you have learnt before and replace them with a entirely new set of mechanics.

I think a lot of game reviewers were probably right with having mixed feelings about it. It’s not a great game in 2021 if this is your first time playing it. I enjoyed it a lot of it out of nostalgia, and most importantly, having watched Twin Peaks since the previous time I played it.

Now, time for some damned good coffee.
