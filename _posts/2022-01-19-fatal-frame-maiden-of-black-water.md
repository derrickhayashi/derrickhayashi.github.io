Having finished one one flash light pointing game, I enter another flash light pointing game. Perhaps I have finished every single game in the flash light pointing genre; I can’t imagine there are many more of them.

Fatal Frame is a Japanese horror game, where the mechanics revolve around defeating spirits by taking pictures of them with a camera. The game is largely set on a mountain, and not too uncommon for mountains in Japan, it is deified and has a complex of shrines. By Japanese horror game, I don’t just mean that it’s developed in Japan. The setting, its story and environment, are Japanese. Shinto shrines are a very fresh and welcome change to the usual western style castles or mansions, not that I’ve played that many horror games to begin with. The environment is a work of art and beauty, and I find myself stopping to pose and take screenshots, something which I don’t often do.

The game is paced rather slow. Characters move slow, and interactions with the environment often involve animations which I feel are longer than necessary. It sets the tone well, but I still can’t help being frustrated by it. Enemies are one point where the design felt a little weak, with a few artwork and models reused often, and also some enemies just being meat sponges.

Given the setting, I decided to play in Japanese instead of English, making this first game that I’ve ever played and finished in Japanese. I think it was a good choice to compliment the setting.

Most of the exposition is told through note scattered throughout the game, with occasional cut scenes. The game world is paused while the notes are being read, which makes it great for reading at my own pace and making Anki flash cards. Oh, so, many flash cards. I felt at some point I was making one for every other sentence.

The story is split into chapters of probably an hour or less for each, alternating between a few different characters as the story is told from their perspective. However, I was taking maybe two hours or even more with all the translation that I was doing. But I was having fun, and learning.

I felt that this was one of the best games I’ve played in a long time.
